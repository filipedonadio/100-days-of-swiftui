# 100 Days of SwiftUI

Projects and solutions to the challenges of the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) Course.

## Why I'm taking this course

I believe this course is an extremely effective way of learning the latest technologies like Swift 5.5, iOS 15, and SwiftUI. It's created for beginners to iOS development but also has tremendous value for experienced developers willing to sharpen some skills and learn new things.

The course is focused on building many different kinds of apps and solving practical challenges by writing your own code, which is one of the best strategies to actually learn.
